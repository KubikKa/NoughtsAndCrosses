> Hi! You're playing a game called 'Noughts and crosses'.

> First, let's discuss the rules üìñ:
1. Decide who will be noughts (O) and who will be crosses (X).
2. The player who chose crosses makes first move. You need to select a square (1-9) where you want to place the cross.
3. Next, the noughts player chooses another square to place the nought in it.
4. Both players continue to take turns to place their symbol in a square aiming to get three (X) or (O) in a row to win.
   Remember, you can not place your symbol in a square which is already occupied!
5. The three in a row can be in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line.

> You can play this game with a friend (press 1) or the computer (press 2). It's up to you üòâ
  Who do you want to play with?
